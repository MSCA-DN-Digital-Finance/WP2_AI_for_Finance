## Objectives
The WP will work on enabling the use of complex AI models in real-world financial settings.
	2.1. To answer the main research questions on solving AI deployment hurdles for industry outlined in the IRPs.
	2.2. To demonstrate the novel dynamic, rating models, automated trading platforms and market environments for RL (CAR, ROY).
	2.3. To disseminate the knowledge validated by an international research centre (FRA, ECB, ARC)


## Description
WP 2 is led by WWU and supported by all partners. The work is divided into the following tasks:

- Task 2.1. Technical coordination. Monitoring the related IRPs, store the output generated in a location accessible to the entire network.
- Task 2.2. Support the research training for all assigned ESRs and contribute to advanced training content
- Task 2.3. Industry Prototype: Propose an accurate, robust, composite, machine learning (ML)-based, dynamic rating model for SMEs.
- Task 2.4. Develop a prototype: platforms for trading with improved the explainability of the AI/ML models and ESG/CSR indicators.
- Task 2.5. Address the main practical challenges of applying RL in real-world financial settings and building open access use cases.
- Task 2.6. Disseminate, communicate and exploit the results (Conferences, OS Day, policy paper, two prototypes, use case, media coverage)

## Deliverables
- D.2.1 Use cases for RL: Use cases for the applicability of RL models (Due in M48)
- D.2.2 Industry prototype for ML models for trading: Industry prototype for automated trading strategies with ML models (Due in M48)
- D.2.3 Technical summary report on AI in Finance: Summary report on all results and impacts related to AI in Finance (Due in M48)
